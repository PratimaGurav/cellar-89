## Deployment

### Using Heroku
- Development Enviroment
  1.  Create env.py : It needs to contain these variables.
    - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
    - Secret key is the password of your choice.
    - [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) postgreSQL.
    ![env file]()
  2. Create requirements.txt file.
  3. Create Procfile containing application name to ensure proper formatting to avoid the deployment to fail.
  4. Commit and push deployment changes to Github.
  5. Create an account and login to Heroku
    - Create a new app, with an appropriate app name and choose a region.
    ![Create App]()
    - In Resources add Heroku Postgres.
    ![Resources]()
    - Within your newly created app go to settings go to Config Vars use the DATABASE_URL Value and add it to your env.py file also you need to connect it via settings.py.
    ![Config Vars]()
    - Create a SECRET_KEY Key and the Value as the desired key.
    - Then go to the Deploy tab next to Deployment Method, click GitHub to connect your account and repository.
    - At the bottom of the page hit deploy branch making sure it is set to main.
